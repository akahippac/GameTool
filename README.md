# GameTool

I wrote this tool last year to pull decrypted, 32 bit binaries from my iPod, put them on my computer in an organized fashion, and upload them back to my phone to save me the hassle of doing it myself.

It is *very* specific to my devices on iOS 9, and will require a lot of rewriting if you want to make it work for yourself.

I am putting this on Github so other developers can see an example of using libimobiledevice to pull and upload files to and from devices.
